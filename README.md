# Functions

**Functions** is a high school project created in Year 4, designed to explore and manipulate polynomials. This interactive program allows you to perform a variety of operations on polynomials, including polynomial representation, root calculation, determinant evaluation, and polynomial addition, subtraction, and multiplication. You can visualize the results on a graph.

## Key Features
- **Polynomial Operations**: Create, manipulate, and represent polynomials with ease.

- **Root Calculation**: Compute the roots of polynomials to understand their solutions.

- **Determinant Evaluation**: Analyze determinants to gain insights into polynomial properties.

- **Polynomial Math**: Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations on polynomials.

- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize polynomial results on a graph for better understanding.
